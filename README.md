# iSpan: Parallel Identification of Strongly Connected Components with Spanning Trees

## Introduction
In this project, we develop a fast spanning tree-based strongly connected component (SCC) parralel algorithm, named iSpan. You can find the source code in "src/", some useful scripts in "script/", and some test result under "result/".

## TODO
More related codes and files will be released soon.
